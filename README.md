### About Rust

<p align = "justify">
  <em>Rust</em> is a general purpose programming languages and is notables fo its emphasis to performance, type safety, concurrency and memory safety. It supports multiple programming paradigms and was influenced by ideas from functions programming, including immutability, higher-order functions, varied order data types and pattern matching. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Wikipedia </a> and <a href = "https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/"> Rust Documentation </a>

## About this source code
<p align = "justify">
  <b>This source code is intended for demo purposes only</b>. Every source code is written purely with rust and runs via cargo package manager. "Cargo" is Rust's build system and package manager for standard libraries. While this source code is intended to be executed using cargo in a native IDE (e.g. Visual Studio), each separate project file can be execured in an online Compiler.

  <b>Recommended Online Compiler</b>

### Important Note
> This reporsitory is a collection of multiple projects, it is not a standalone

### How to run this source code?
<p align ="justify">
  There are two general way to run these source codes: Either by using an <a href = "https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_rust_compiler">online compiler</a> or by a local compiler (using Cargo) in visual studio code. Each source code within the file collection pool of a rust project is always contained in an <em>"src"</em> folder

#### Running a source code in an online compiler
<p align ="justify">
  Running a rust source code in an online compiler is a straight forward process. <br> <br>
  1. Navigate through the "src" folder of a rust project and open the main rust file. <br>
  2. Copy the source code from the source file and create a new project in the online compiler. <br>
  3. Paste the source code in the created project from the online compiler and execute the source code. <br>
